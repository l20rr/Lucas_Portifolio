            <h2> Developer</h2>
            
            <p>
              I have completed a Higher Technical Specialization Course (CET) in Information Systems Programming, Level 5. <br/>
              <br/>
              During my internship at WIG - Work is Good, I gained valuable experience in software development. I learned to work with technologies such as .NET Core and Blazor, implemented unit tests, and conducted deployments on Azure. I collaborated effectively within a team using GitHub and had the opportunity to plan and develop three complete Proof of Concepts in full-stack Blazor projects.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Creative, self-motivated, and inquisitive, these are my key traits that have enabled me to develop skills with JavaScript and C# technologies.
