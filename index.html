            <h1> About</h1>
            <hr/>
            <p>
              I have completed a Higher Technical Specialization Course (CET) in Information Systems Programming, Level 5. <br/>
              <br/>
              During my internship at WIG - Work is Good, I gained valuable experience in software development. I learned to work with technologies such as .NET Core and Blazor, implemented unit tests, and conducted deployments on Azure. I collaborated effectively within a team using GitHub and had the opportunity to plan and develop three complete Proof of Concepts in full-stack Blazor projects.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I believe that a developer should not limit themselves to just writing code but should understand the entire process and actively seek solutions. I value innovation and creativity in my development work. My goal is to deliver high-value solutions to clients with an excellent user experience.
              <br/>
              Creative, self-motivated, and inquisitive, these are my key traits that have enabled me to develop skills with JavaScript and C# technologies.
