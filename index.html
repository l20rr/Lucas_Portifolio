            <h1>About</h1>
            <hr/>
            <p>
                I have completed a Higher Technical Specialization Course (CET) in Information Systems Programming, Level 5. 
                During my internship at WIG - Work is Good, I gained valuable experience in software development. I learned to work with technologies such as .NET Core and Blazor, implemented unit tests, and conducted deployments on Azure. I collaborated effectively within a team using GitHub and had the opportunity to plan and develop three complete Proof of Concepts in full-stack Blazor projects.
                
                I believe that a developer should not limit themselves to just writing code but should understand the entire process and actively seek solutions. I value innovation and creativity in my development work. My goal is to deliver high-value solutions to clients with an excellent user experience.
                
                Creative, self-motivated, and inquisitive, these are my key traits that have enabled me to develop skills with JavaScript and C# technologies.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I went to Oxford to improve my English and experience different cultures.

                I had the opportunity to immerse myself in various cultural environments and converse with people from diverse backgrounds.
                
                I met individuals from Spain, England, Mexico, Colombia, France, Poland, the Netherlands, Brazil, Italy, Chile, Japan and Portugal. Each of these countries has a wonderful culture, offering me a new perspective on the world. I made friends with people of incredible nationalities.
                
                This experience significantly enhanced my skills, especially my social skills. I became better at solving problems, speaking different languages, explaining technologies, and being a good listener.
                
                Now, as I return home to Portugal, I bring with me a new version of myself and new dreams.
                My objective has been achieved.
